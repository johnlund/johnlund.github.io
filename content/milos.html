<h2>Miloš and His Fox</h2><h4>January 31, 2012</h4><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We were just sitting there in the grass, enjoying our popcorn, when this fox–out of nowhere–comes leaping from the bushes next to me and goes straight for my bag of popcorn.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So, what did you do?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you think? I screamed, dropped the bag, and jumped up. The fox looked up at us with this smirk on it's face, as if it knew exactly what it was doing.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Man... so what happened next?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, the fox is having a ball, practically rolling around in the grass with our popcorn when this drunken carny comes after it, yelling and swearing up a storm, shaking his fist. We all look at the guy and quick as a devil the fox grabs the bag in its teeth and bolts back through the bushes. It was a total mess–our blanket, all our stuff. The carny, supposedly in charge of the thing, doesn't even look our direction. He starts swearing again and heads back from wherever he came from. We just stood there trying to figure out what just happened. It was surreal.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Crazy...”<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš looks up at the clear sky and warm sun, thinking to himself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're gonna cash in today.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He throws back his head and swallows the shot of vodka. Before the burn even hits his stomach, he comes out from behind the canvas of his stall and takes a quick look around. A few of the hand-made stuffed animals hanging on the wall are missing, so he bends down and pulls a couple more from under the counter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carnival is full of people today, laughing, having fun. Some of them even have their shirts off–running around with cotton candy in their hands. All around him, the frenzied pace of the carnival flies by.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the days that make it all worth-while.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, hot days when the whole town is out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, who knows, the thing probably had rabies or something...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš clenches his teeth to restrain himself as he overhears those spoiled brats walking by him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the hell do they think they are?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All they lost was some popcorn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bitch has run me out of house and home.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turns back as a new customer approaches his stall. He forces a smile, but the guy doesn't notice. Hopped up on funnel cake and dollar bills, the only thing the customers see are the games.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has fallen down the side of the sky and now only dusts the carnival with its red-gold light. Instead of relaxing during the only real break in the day–dinner-time–Miloš has to take care of some business, no matter how much he dreads doing it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drops the canvas walls of his tent and ducks out. He moves through the narrow corridors behind the stalls of the carnival purposefully. These pathways connect the games, food stands, vendors, makeshift homes, and offices of the carnival like the corn maze that is often set up in the fall; knowing how to get from one place to another without seeing a single customer is a rite of passage here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blissful spell from earlier in the day had been shattered by those damn kids. Now, the shots of vodka he drank a few hours ago are wearing thin, and the dull throb at his temples grabs for his attention. But he needs to appear sober at this meeting–it could mean his livelihood.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the incident with Fox and that popcorn party, those damn kids made a big enough scene that the story found its way to the ears of the one person who you didn't want to hear your name, Pinky.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinky the Boss sits in his trailer-office sucking on his caramel apple pops until the sugary juice runs down his hands–all over that huge gold ring jammed on his little finger, which–among the traveling crew of this giant roadside debacle–gives him his name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been two years since Miloš' last meeting with that fat, golden, caramel pinky ring, and he barely made it out of the last one with his job.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš knows that the reason he's being called in to see Pinky today is the same as it was then. Two years ago, he found a young fox scratching around the small animal cages. At first, Miloš hollered at the animal in an attempt to scare it off like so many foxes before. This particular fox ducked underneath a large crate and looked up at him with two big, innocent eyes. He wasn't able to resist her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took some time, but over a couple hours of gentle reassurance, he had been able to coax her to come out and eat some berries. Strangely, the fox seemed to know just how to seduce humans, and in an ironic twist for a carnival worker, she knew a sucker when she saw one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once he earned her trust, he had led her back to his trailer with a steady stream of berries. She had darted from structure to structure, only running out after he walked a few paces. The carnival had just arrived in town, so over the next week he had courted the Fox–leaving out food and milk every night. He rarely saw her take the food the first day or two, but by the end of the week, she was willing to sit next to his lawn chair while he ate his late-night dinners.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things had stayed the same while the carnival had been in town, but Fox disappeared when the word came that they would be leaving soon. Two days went by with no sign of her. On the last night before the carnival left, Miloš prepared a small corner of his trailer with food, milk and a couple of blankets. He left the door slightly open.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning, Fox was curled up in the blankets. Miloš smiled and walked past her to the door. He looked back at her sleeping peacefully on the blankets. The oddity of the situation bounced around in his head for a moment; but as he looked at her, it seemed that the corners of her mouth turned up into a smile and he lost his train of thought. She looked beautiful.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months after he found her, an incident caused Miloš to be called into Pinky's office for the first time since he had started working for the carnival. Fox got into one of the two-headed animal cages and tore the poor bastard to shreds. Absorbing countless obscenities, Miloš promised the Boss that something like that would never happen again, and it hadn't–as far as Pinky knew.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning from his memories, Miloš turns the corner and sees it. Pinky's fortress is nestled into the maze of corridors, tents and stalls surrounding it. It seems that the large yet unassuming metal structure should be lost among the hubbub of activity, but the place radiates some kind of forcefield that encompasses the entire carnival.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš slows as he approaches the office. He begins to prepare for his appointment by sorting through his arguments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, I hate this guy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, how can I convince him that Fox should stay?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the good things about her?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's beautiful, smart, devious (damn that bitch when she got into those jars of caviar I could have killed her right then).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might call her trained (that's a blatant lie and you know it, she does whatever she damn well pleases).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexy (is that strange? no, animals can be sexy), soft, funny (that's not a good idea–she just tore those damn kids' lunch to pieces).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that's a pretty good list. How can he argue with that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shit...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm screwed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš knocks once and that deep voice full of caramel comes through the door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesssss...”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš pushes open the door. Rusty hinges screech to welcome him into the dark, cluttered room of the Boss.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sneer, Pinky says, “Miloš, my friend, have a seat.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš sidles up to the front of the desk and sits in one of the beat-up, cushioned, patent leather chairs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I'm going to make this short and sweet.” Pinky pulls the wrapper off a fresh caramel apple pop to emphasize his point.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This animal that you have been keeping around your trailer can no longer stay here. Because I'm a generous man, I'm giving you two options. One, bring her over to the stable and we'll make sure she's taken care of.” A soft snort escaped from the Boss's thick, rotund throat. “Two, handle it yourself. But the animal must be gone by morning. If I hear that it's around here again, I'll make sure that it's taken care of, and you'll be arrested for trespassing.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But, sir–”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No buts, Miloš. That's all. Get out.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night comes quickly to the carnival. The once hot sun drifts slowly down the side of the sky and it's golden light, like the caramel from the apple pops, drains from the world.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš comes out of the Boss's trailer as darkness falls. His head spins with questions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could I have done, what should I have said to make Pinky understand?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can it be like this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can he just throw her out on the street?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the time I've spent working here for him–all my friends, my home.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't fair.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can't be happening.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in his thoughts, Miloš moves away from the trailer and starts heading home.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screams and shadows chase Miloš from his reverie. He's drawn back to cacophony of noises and movement around him. The harsh glow of flood lights and neon signs make the faces laughing around him look like skeletons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without knowing it, he had walked into the middle of a large crowd of people. He now finds them shoving around him, laughing and talking loudly, spilling their drinks and funnel cakes like a drunken mob. The air is filled with the tinny music of the games around him. After years here, he is so used to the endless loop of music that he normally ignores it, but tonight it reverberates in his head. He feels lost and alone–like a forgotten coin in a washing machine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a small noise breaks through the music around him, and Miloš stops moving. He stands in front of the house of mirrors; waiting as the crowd moves past him. He takes a tentative step closer to the building.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His carnival's house of mirrors is not one of the main attractions. Two stories tall, it's large and complex with many dark, winding corridors. Teenagers and young adults scare each other inside, but it doesn't appeal to anyone else. Looking up at it now, Miloš wonders why it's still standing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must bring a profit for Pinky to keep it around.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again he hears the noise. It sounds like a child crying, but is indistinct–he can't tell for sure. He hesitates on the steps of the building. He wants to get back to his trailer as soon as possible and figure out what to do about Fox. But if there's a child in there, he has to do something. With one last look back at the bright lights of the fair behind him, he heads into the large, indoor maze of strange mirrors and dead ends.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights of the carnival outside diminish to shafts of colored lights that reflect off of the mirrors in front of Miloš. The inside, lit only by soft bulbs strung every 6 feet or so along a wire on the ceiling, is quiet. He can hear distant footfalls from the second story above him, but the only other sound is the distant medley of the games and people outside. Miloš stands without moving for a few moments. He starts to wonder if he imagined the noise, or maybe some lost kid already found his way out of the place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he turns around, the sound of a muffled sob comes from the corridors behind him. Miloš turns back and heads in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chuckles to himself after only a minute of walking. He's already disoriented and unsure of which hallway leads back to the entrance. Every wall, every room–it all looks exactly the same; the same dusty wooden floor, the same light bulbs flickering along the ceiling, the same chaotic mirrors, the same dead ends and mysterious turns that lead into more mirrored paths.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš looks up and notices that whoever strung the lights hadn't bothered to send them down certain paths.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the ones that don't go too far.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least that gives me a central route through this place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another minute he hears a cough close by. In front of him, the hallway comes to an abrupt turn, and the string of bulbs ends. Miloš continues forward and is surprised to find the dark, short hallway to his left. The mirror at the entrance reflects all of the light back down the larger corridor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees a small boy sitting against the wall on the dusty, dirty floor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moves closer to the boy and asks, “Are you alright?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy looks up and brushes off his dirty hands. His face is wet with tears and mud and his lips quiver. A glimmer of hope passes across his face when he sees Miloš looking down at him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I..I lost m-my friend.” With those words the boy swallows another sob and looks down at a discarded taffy wrapper on the floor next to him as if it is the remedy for all his sadness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, let's find them. They should be close.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš bends down and picks the small boy up in his arms. He turns the corner, looks up and follows the string of bulbs out of the house of mirrors and into the lights and sounds of the fair.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once outside, he puts the boy down onto his feet and examines the faces of the people near the building. He sees a young girl over by the taffy stand with a worried expression on her face. He smiles down at the boy and points to the girl, “Do you know her?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy's face lights up with joy and he smiles at Miloš, “That's her! Thank you mister.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy runs to his friend with a skip in his step. Miloš watches the two children hug. The girl hands the boy a piece of salt-water taffy. Despite himself, he smiles and thinks of Fox. He blinks hard and runs his hand through his hair.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš stands in front of the door to his dark trailer, his eyes closed and his mind racing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a breath.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything will be ok.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabs the handle for the door and pulls it open. A sharp metal on metal screech echoes off the walls of the trailers around him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside it's dark and stale. Miloš reaches out and switches on the overhead light and the interior flickers to life with a dull, yellow glow like a room in a faded picture from decades ago. The furniture, patterns and colors are from another era, but the drab surroundings escape Miloš's attention. He only sees signs of her: the torn upholstery of the couch and chairs, shredded by her claws and teeth; spilled water and stale food left out on the kitchen floor in case she comes home hungry; the cold, drafty air coming in from the self-made dog-door in the bottom of the wall. Looking around, his eyes start to well up again, but he checks himself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't let her see me like this. The bitch'll know something's up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not going to tell her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll leave together in the morning; find a place to settle down. I'll get another job.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've done it before and I'll do it again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be good. But as long as I have her, I'll be alright.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving with a slow determination, Miloš begins to tidy up the trailer. She'll be here soon once she notices the light on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's staring at himself in the mirror of the tiny, square bathroom when he hears a rustle and scratching in the dirt outside. Then the familiar flap of the dog-door. His heart skips a beat with the excitement of her entrance into this world, and then quickly sinks from the dread of their unknown future.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He comes out of the bathroom and looks towards his room–she was always waiting for him there.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched out on the bed is his Fox. Her milky, white skin reflects the yellow light of the trailer with a softness and sweetness that comes from within her. Her eyes flicker like the embers of a dormant fire. She is dressed in silky, flowing fabrics which seem to move on their own. She lies lazily on the bed, completely still, with her eyes locked on him. Effortlessly seducing, a whisper of a smile appears on her lips, and a barely audible animal sound escapes from her throat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights behind him dim, and the stars and silver moon shining through the window put out the fire in her eyes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He takes an unsteady step into the room–compelled by her call, but wary of its consequences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't submit to her tonight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything will change in the morning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sly smile broadens and the shadows of the room seem to dance in time with her mirth. She beckons to him again. He weakens. He hurries forward, stepping awkwardly as his pulls off his shoes, socks, pants–anything that would come between him and her enticing touch.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the bed, he regains his somber mood as his mind catches up with his heart. He worries once again about their uncertain future–the danger and challenges they would have to face together. He imagines terrible things: she might be taken, harmed; she might go hungry without the food and small animals she feeds off of here; he might be unable to keep her happy, and she would leave him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her foot reaches out over the edge of the bed, and she curls her toes around his leg. There's no resistance now. He climbs onto the bed and lowers himself to lay next to her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leans into him, and he closes his eyes so that his other senses can soak in her presence. Her body brushes against his skin; the sweet smell of her hair tickles his nose, the delicate warmth of her breath on his ear whispers to him in the silent night.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's gone before he wakes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miloš slides out of bed, feeling light and well despite his deepening feeling of dread. He tries not to worry. She often leaves in the morning before he gets out of bed, but she always returns shortly after he is up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stops in the hallway. The grey light of morning crawls in through the shades of his trailer. He looks around and notices that things are different: the upholstery of his couch and chairs is smooth and strong; clean, empty dishes are lying on the floor of the kitchen; the room is warm and sealed against the cold morning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's gone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resigned feeling suddenly washes over him. Like a wall finally coming down, his emotions flow through him. First, anger that she would leave like this, then sadness. He moves into the room and stumbles into a chair. A single tear drops from his eye. It rolls down his cheek and falls onto the table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had known that this day would come. Now that it was here, he feels comfort without knowing why. For a long time, thoughts roll around his head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can't be.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is she?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't lose her now.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will I do without her?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would she leave?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did I do wrong?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have told her I loved her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noise from outside makes him look up and out his window. He pulls on the pair of dirty jeans lying on the floor and opens his front door to the morning air. His neighbor and friend is outside sweeping the space between their trailers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Have you seen her?” Miloš asks.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Seen who?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fox.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fox!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you alright Miloš? I don't know what you are talking about.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My Fox, we've been together for the last couple years. You know who I mean.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend stops cleaning and looks him in the eye.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don't know who you mean my friend, but you should be getting ready for the day, the sun is already up.”</p>
