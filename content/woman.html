<h2>The Perfect Woman</h2><h4>2007</h4><br><p>I would like to describe the perfect woman, or as close as I can come to describing her at this point in my life. She is intelligent, inspiring, loyal, hard-working, sexy, magical, musical, open-minded, fun, courageous and... well, that's good for now. Intelligent: she is able to do anything, willing to learn anything, and enjoys using her mind as often as she can. Her ability to inspire comes from her whole unique personality and hopeful, positive outlook on life, so hold off on that one. Loyalty is self-explanatory. She is willing to do something she hates for the experience. To me, this one is very important right now–she is sexy. She understands her sexuality and loves it. Magic and spirituality are the same. It's important that she works to know and understand the hidden mysteries of this universe. Her musical abilities are becoming more and more important to me because of the way that they tie into a lot of other characteristics like magical, intelligent, inspiring and courageous, so she should enjoy playing and listening to music. The ability to stay positive and cope with any situation is vital; her open-mind is a big key to the rest of her personality. She should be–and love having–fun. And finally courage, not really something you would think of in a woman–well maybe you would, but this is very important as well and ties into most of the other aspects.

Maybe I'm asking too much. I dont think I'm as good as this person is, but that's actually one of the points. I want to learn from this woman every day and I want to teach her the things that I'm able to. But she must be willing to change, grow and learn together. It may be hard to find this person, hopefully I'm able to get closer and closer as I grow until I find perfection.</p>
