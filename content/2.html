<h2>Untitled</h2><h4></h4><br>
<p>Do you like me?<br>
Do you know<br>
What I'm like, and<br>
Why I sigh?<br>
Could you tell me<br>
Any-thing,<br>
Or would you<br>
Have to lie?<br>
When we pass<br>
And I say hi,<br>
Will you invite me<br>
To come by?<br>
<br>
The important things<br>
Are hard to find,<br>
The important things<br>
May make you cry,<br>
The important things<br>
In life aren’t mine.<br>
Until this life<br>
Has passed you by,<br>
The important things<br>
Aren’t important.<br>
Why?</p>
