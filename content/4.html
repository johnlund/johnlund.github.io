<h2>The Good King</h2><h4>January 4, 2011</h4><br><p>There once was a man who was waiting to be king. He had spent his whole life living in the shadow of his father. Every day, he walked around his father's castle and thought about what he would do when he finally had the power to make some changes in the world: he had a beautiful princess, which he was going to marry, and he was going to fix all the problems his father, the king, had produced from his reign.
<br><br>
One day he was walking along, lost in thought. He was thinking about how he was going to give the merchants lower taxes so they could afford to hire more employees and sell more, helping everyone by giving more jobs to the people. He looked up and realized he had wandered into his father's throne room. His father was giving audience to a wealthy traveler who had requested a short meeting with the king to pay his respects as he passed through the kingdom.
<br><br>
He caught his father in the middle of the conversation, “Remember my friend, this world is full of those who would choose to hurt you for their own advantage. Always seek after the good, the beautiful, and the true, and you will never regret the choices you make.”
<br><br>
His father was full of such nonsense as that. What do those things ever get for you? Power and the intelligence to take advantage of that power would give you the world.
<br><br>
Years later, the prince had become the king. He had his beautiful wife by his side, and he had all the power to do what he wished. Now, there was a man in front of him who had come into his kingdom to say his master was on the border with more armies than could be seen by a single man. His master asked the king to surrender now and swear his allegiance to the new power, or be destroyed.
<br><br>
The king looked to his queen. He kept his eyes on her as his heart and his mind looked into his future, and that of his kingdom. After all his visions of what might happen, he held his wife's unforgettable green eyes with his own. His only thought was that those were the sweetest eyes he'd ever seen.
<br><br>
He slowly turned to face the man.
<br><br>
“Tell your master that we will always seek after the good, the beautiful, and the true. If we must, we will die for those things.”</p>
