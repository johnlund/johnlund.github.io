<h2>The Philosophy</h2><h4>2003</h4><br><p>...It is this world. I don't agree with the rules of it. How can I change this world so that I am happy? That question makes me happy. To know that I can be happy without changing myself. I don't think writing is what I really want to do. I entertain the notion of it because it touches on what I want. But I don't want to work that way. I can only imagine change coming through violence. I understand the pain, the self-perpetuating violence that results from it. I must admit that this world craves it–this body craves it. If I am bored with it then I should change it. I move through these moods so quickly though. Every day I want something else. What will make me happy? Nothing. Nothing will make me happy. And yet now I am. I am. I want the world to work so that you can do whatever you want and be happy. I want to have nothing and yet have anything. I want to believe that I can fly, and that my love and I will be together forever. That I can see my friends whenever I want. I don't ever want to worry or even think about money–or possessions. I want to sit and think and I want to chop wood. I want the American dream. I want to leave everything and move to the west where there are cowboys and saloons and only the desert tells you what you should do. I want to live in anything and everything, just for one day. I want to think about what I want. And I want to want everything and get nothing. Because if I had all these things that I wanted I wouldn't want anything, but would I be happy? I want to dream. I want to dream all day, and all night. I don't want to do something because it's smart, or because it will make me successful, or rich, or happy. I want to do something because I want to do it, maybe solely because it is fucking stupid. I want freedom. I want to sit and listen to music all day and not give a shit about it. I want to sleep in until 2 and not even care. I don't want to grow up, but I want what grown-ups have. Then I have to believe. I always have. I don't want to think about my fucking school loans. I want a dad and a mom. I don't want to feel sorry for mysef. I want to record a song one day and then save a life the next day. I feel like the way to do all this is to have all the money you want. This isn't right. Money is the root of all evil. I want the world to be free from the grip of the $. How do we do it? We have to be willing.</p>
