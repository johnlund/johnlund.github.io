<h2>Freedom</h2>
<br>
<p>The seagulls soar overhead<br>
Screaming with delight as they dive.<br>
Sweet, cool, ocean air under their wings;<br>
He finds a perch.<br>
<br>
No longer a part of the group–<br>
A lone traveler on a distant beach.<br>
White foam sprays all around,<br>
But he doesn’t frown for a thing.<br>
<br>
The world is bright and new,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exciting and blue.<br>
A seagull wonders if there is anything more<br>
He should be doing before he explores.<br>
<br>
Forget that and forget them.<br>
The world is mine.<br>
The seagull takes off,<br>
And soars...</p>
