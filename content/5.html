<h2>Deliberate Days</h2><h4>March 1, 2011</h4><br><p>Deliberate days doing nothing.<br>
Deliberately dazed, disbelieving everything.<br>
<br>
An image comes to mind–lost in reality–<br>
found again in the dark, a day-dream.<br>
<br>
Without meaning or purpose–lost in reality–<br>
life inches and crashes, a night-dream.<br>
<br>
A boat without anchor feels the sweeping bliss of freedom.<br>
A thought without form knows the wasted tragedy of desire.</p>
