<h2>The Snake and the Bird in the Tree</h2><h4>February 4, 2009</h4><br><p>A long time ago, before there were clear, blue skies with clouds that floated lazily by and people to think them out of existence there lived a snake. There were actually many snakes and birds and beavers and all other sorts of animals, but this story is about just one of these snakes. He was the biggest snake of them all, a giant that was bigger than a bus and reached up to a human's thighs when he was slithering on the ground. Buses and humans hadn't come around yet though, so he didn't really know exactly how big he was, just that he was always looking down on the snakes and most of the other animals around him.
<br><br>
Once in awhile he would come upon another creature that was big like him and they would talk for awhile, but eventually they both knew that they couldn't stay together in one place for too long because they ate too much food. The snake and the other huge creature would start wandering farther and farther away from each other every day to get their dinner and one day they wouldn't be able to meet up again to share smiles and stories over comfortable, full bellies. The snake had gotten used to this after awhile and so had most of the other big animals that roamed all over the world with him.
<br><br>
One day, while the snake was sleepily hanging in a tree over a river watching the water carry the world past him, he heard a tremendous noise in the air above him. The snake looked up and saw a giant winged bird flying down, about to land right on top of him. He pulled himself up and showed his huge fangs off to this creature, not meanly, but just to show that this was his tree and he was about to take a nap and didn't want to be disturbed. Well this bird wasn't having it, she had chosen this tree of all the smaller trees along the river because it was the best, and she always had the best. Long ago the snake had learned not to start fights with the other big animals around him, and this one was no different. He thought that they might be able to share the tree. He could rest in the bottom by the water, and the bird could stay up on the top by the sky.
<br><br>
This seemed perfectly logical to the snake and so he moved down a little bit to rest on the lower branches. Happily, he looked up again and saw that the bird had landed on the upper branches and seemed perfectly content to stay there. He smiled at the comforting feeling he was already getting from being next to such a beautiful creature as himself and quickly drifted off to sleep.

Right in his ear, the bird screamed. Waking him out of his daze before it was even dark outside. The snake usually lived in a pretty nice routine, always hunting during the night through the early morning so that by the time the sun came up and warmed the world, he could enjoy the day. This disturbance had messed up his whole plan and now he would not be able to get back to sleep and he would have to go hunting when the animals were still awake and if he caught an animal, it would be too early and he would have to go back to sleep and his whole day would be ruined. Who did this bird think that she was?
<br><br>
SQWAK!
<br><br>
Again the bird screamed right at him, noticing that he was awake now. He looked up at the bird, bared his fangs and lowered his head back down to the water to get a drink. He sipped a little bit when the bird started poking her beak at his head. Calmly, so that there was no threat in his actions, he pulled his head back up and sighed. He knew that his peace had been shattered and so he started to move his body to climb to another part of the tree. As he was turning around, he happened to coil around one of the birds legs and realized it a little bit too late when the bird screamed again and start scratching and peaking at him.
<br><br>
Shocked by this unforeseen violence, the snake bit back at the bird. She must have been shocked to be attacked by such a large snake and didn't react in time to dodge his bite. Acting out of instinct from the attack and realizing too late what he was doing, his venom went into the bird's back and quickly he felt the bird start to slow down. He pulled his fangs out fast and started thinking of anything he could do to save the wonderful, dying bird. He looked into her large, dark eyes and saw the beautiful light that had been so proud and strong fading. He knew that there was nothing he could do, his poison was too strong, it was what made him so good at hunting.
<br><br>
All he could do was watch as the bird silently cried out to him. The powerful life fighting desperately for something to grab a hold of as it slipped slowly into darkness. The snake begged for the bird's life, so ashamed and horrified by what he had done that he would gladly have given his own life if he could have. The bird's last moment brought the cold, blank stare of death to the eye and the snake became painfully away of the reflection staring back at him. Relaxing his body, the bird's leg became untangled and she slipped out of the tree and crashed into the water with a sickening splash that forced the eyes of the snake shut.
<br><br>
The darkness of night surrounded the snake as he slid from the tree onto the cold, hard dirt. His mind was as dead as the beauty he had so carelessly taken from this world. He moved along through the grass not knowing where he was going, not caring. The snake quietly faded from the world. No longer the proud, strong creature he once was, but carrying the scars of his failure into the forgiving blindness of history.
<br><br>
We humans don't speak much anymore of the snake and that day in the tree, when fate dealt a losing hand to two of the world's wonderful beasts. Now we have green grass and flowers to turn into crowns, soft winds that blow the smell of a cherry pie baking in the oven across fields of wheat. Even with all of our beauty, it is good once and awhile to remember the goodness that was lost that day, so that we may have the chance to stop ourselves from making the same mistake when our moment comes.</p>
