<h2>Frotha</h2><h4>January 29, 1999</h4><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the center of the room, his eyes darting quickly around, trying to take in all the information they could. The walls were jagged rock, and there seemed to be no exit. As he turned around to look if there was a way out the gravel under his feet crunched and he realized that he was trapped.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep growl with the power of a strike of thunder shook him to the core. He froze trying to remember how he got here. He had been talking with his father, something about the situation with his mother. Another growl, the force of it almost tangible. He thought back to his father. He had been in the throne room, talking about his mother. He said something, and it seemed to trigger something to force him into unconsciousness. He thought to himself what is was he could have said. He couldn't remember.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the growl, strong as thunder seemed to come from within the rock room. He spun around, fear plowing through his mind. Nothing. He heard a crunch of gravel to his left side sliding to his right and turning left at the same time, trying to avoid the maker of the sound. His eyes, already ajusted to the darkness could make out a form about his size, a smalled frame, but near his height. Instinct took a hold of him and he reached for his Grendred, the blade passed down through his family from the ancient Givers. He felt the cold touch of diamond as his hand reached the hilt. With the speed of youth he both drew the blade into his left hand and recoiled into the stance he was trained in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouching low, he spoke, "Who goes there?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in front of him leaned onto his left foot and leapt. Te deep growl coming forth from him again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his blade in hand he felt only the slight fear that he didn't know what this creature was. His fear was overrun with exictment as he looked upon the flying thing. Feinting to the right and jabbing with the blade in his left, he felt the pressure as the point of his sword passed into the creatures abdomen. Pride filled his mind and he pulled the blade back to draw it out of his adversary. Instead of coming his motion pulled the figure inces away from him. Deathly fear shot through his mind when he saw the small dagger his opponent held. With speed unseen before, the creature pushed the dagger through the young mans chest, drawing the life from his veins.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king sat baffled, his son had fallen. Fallen straight through the floor of his throne room. He sat for moments, thinking this a joke from his son. After a minute he knew it was no joke.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yelled for his guard. After only seconds, a guard rushed through the door hidden from  visitors, behind a veil of a wall. The guard stood, waiting for the king's order he knew would come.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king, still amazed, commanded, "Listen carefully, go to the captain of the guards quarters. Tell Tirnet to get Frotha. Do it now!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinting, the guard went off to obey, thinking it strange that the king asked for this Frotha, someone he had never heard of.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the guards, known as Tirnet, sat looking over plans for a raid on a smugglers outpost when a man in full run flew past his door. As he past, the captain felt an feeling of fear rush over him. Thinking what could cause this man to be running when the king's orders stated not to while his newborn was in the castle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The running man skidded to a stop and turned back around, he jogged to the door he had passed and looked in. "Sir, something has happened. The king asks for Frotha."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirnet spun around, Frotha? He hadn't heard that name in years. "Are you sure he said Frotha?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirnet knew this to be no lie, few people knew the name of the traitor held in the deepest chamber of the dungeon. He spoke to the guard. "Get a few of the stronger guards together and return to the kings side. Tell him his order is being carried out. If he dismisses you stay out of his sight but remain where you can hear if anything happens."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes sir." The man ran off, obeying.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirnet quickly stood and turned to the steel door guarding the entrance to the dungeons. He put his hand on a scanner and the door swung open into the force-field generator's room. He had a secret path worked out to Frotha's cell so that no man other than those who knew, would be able to reach him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slight tap of the foot in the correct spot entered the door just before the thick blacksteel cell-door. He strode through the tunnel of rock, looking up and imagining his guards standing just outside the throne room above him. He got to the door and activated his personal force-field, and stepped through the tunnels force-field before protecting any chance of escape. He pressed his hand into a hidden hole in the rock and withdraw a Teslarglove. A glove with strong currents of electricity flowing through the mesh of wires on its surface. He slipped his hand in it, and opened the cell-door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the door opened the dim lights high above them turned on, and the holograms turned off. He glanced around, looking at the vast amount of room wasted on this traitor. The ceiling was a good 10 meters above his head, and the room was about five meters by five meters. He found the traitor Tirnet and a deep grimace set into his face. Thinking that he would do anything to rid the castle of this scum. But the king wished against it, trying to decide what action to take against the traitor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirnet was quite ragged, tattered robes hung loosely over his small frame. A normal Hietar suit beneath the robes. His hair was not long, strange, it should be. No trimmer had seen this man for 5 years now. Dirt was caked of his forehead and hands, his dark brown eyes staring at the guard. He sat in a corner, a bundle to his right.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirnet had no patience for the traitor and he did not attempt to hide the scorn and contempt in his voice. "Get up, and come here."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frotha spoke quietly, with a smooth voice. "I have something for your dear king."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king wants nothing from you."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh I think he will want this." With a sudden jerk he threw the sword to the guards feet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without even looking down he knew what it was. The sword radiated power beyond imangination. How had this man got it, the kings own son was the one who owned the Grendred now. He squinted his eyes, thinking, could this man have hurt the heir to the throne? He looked up and saw a tunnel into the ceiling and remembered he was directly under the throne room. A small cylinder lay directly underneath the vertical tunnel. It looked like an old injection tool. His fear caught up with him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without another word he turned and slammed open the cell door, turned and locked it behind him. He ran at full speed through the tunnels out the secret door and through the castle. He burst into the throne room, looking at the king. Panting he stuttered the words out, "W-w-what happened?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king stared at him and spoke with strength, "My son fell through this floor. Have you got Frotha with you?"</p>
