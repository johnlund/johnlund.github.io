<h2>Desert Night</h2><h4>October 8, 2009</h4><br><p>The night was dark and warm, with a strong breeze, the kind that gave you chills when it blew past despite the temperature. A half moon hung limply in the sky, providing just enough light to see the dark forms of shrubs and trees scattered about the desert landscape. Now that the sun was down the darkness was alive with small creatures, lizards and scorpions that darted from place to place searching for a meal. Faded constellations shone through clouds that were listlessly sweeping across the sky. There was a feeling of stillness and impending action, like the calm before a storm.</p>
