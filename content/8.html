<h2>Folie à Deux</h2><h4>December 12, 2012</h4><br>
<p>Madness. It sneaks up on you.<br>
You lose your sense of reason,<br>
and find it in the strangest place.<br>
But it's different than before.<br>
<br>
You try to see why.<br>
What's changed inside your mind?<br>
Is there something missing?<br>
Or something more, which wasn't there before?<br>
<br>
The shape has changed.<br>
And the function it seems.<br>
What was once empty has been filled.<br>
What was once full is empty.<br>
<br>
Now, there's a sweet smell that smiles.<br>
A shade of brown makes you laugh.<br>
The cold touch of the sea is hot as steam.<br>
A silent, lasting look–like breath–<br>
is full of meaning, yet leaves you empty.<br>
<br>
This is something complicated;<br>
a mystery not to be solved.<br>
This is not trivial, but serious thinking.<br>
Despite your dreams, it passes through.<br>
<br>
Your conversion is assured.<br>
It comes wrapped in pink;<br>
dancing and dripping red wine on the wind.<br>
Is it love, or folie à deux?</p>
