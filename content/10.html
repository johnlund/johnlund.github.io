<h2>Chico</h2><h4>November 29, 2007</h4><br><p>Chico, seemingly born into this life, is once again led by hand from his comrades to the little room where it is his job to entertain. He enters the room and is closed in to spend his hour providing laughter and enjoyment for the spectators around him. His first order of business is to secure the limits of the room, searching for the exit that must one day exist.
<br><br>
Chico’s energetic search of the area garners delight from the crowd, but he only mumbles and continues his simple exploration. Once satisfied, he bunkers down in the corner to wait out his stay in the room, but those watching him are shocked and disappointed that he would not entertain them in a more energetic fashion. They begin to shout and whoop to spur him into some kind of action. This noise gets the attention of his friends inside who call out to Chico, wondering how he is doing. He runs over to the wall nearest his buddies and yells back to them, wishing that his duty would be cut short today.
<br><br>
Minutes slowly pass, the crowd never abating and Chico only becoming more agitated. Eventually he can take it no more and begins shouting as loud as he can, storming around the room and hitting the walls, screaming and demanding to be released; at the very least hoping to intimidate the spectators who are amused with his suffering. This new energy draws delightful cheers from the crowd and the intimidation is without effect. As everyone knows, there is no way Chico can reach them. The new chants and calls of the spectators remind him of the vicious calls and violence that he knew in his homeland. He once again claims the corner to think about which is worse, violence or humiliation.
<br><br>
Soon, his self-respect lost after only 20 minutes of solitude and humiliation, he begins begging—asking for something, anything to regain his honor. He shows his open palm to those watching him and they instantly understand, so similar are their minds. At once they begin throwing things at him, anything that they can find, hoping to see Chico react  for they are becoming bored with him sitting in the corner. Unfortunately for all those involved, Chico doesn’t want what they throw and matters only seem to be getting worse. His room is littered with trash and he can find no escape from it; his mind and will are broken down from the constant screaming of the crowd. Once again, he returns to the corner to gain what little privacy and honor he can. His return and inactivity only dismay the crowd and their boredom and anger at his inaction culminates in cursing and spitting at him as they walk away.
<br><br>
Chico sits out the rest of his time in relative peace before he is once again led back to his friends inside.</p>
