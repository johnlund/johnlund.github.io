<h2>Hula Hoop</h2><h4>April 5, 2013</h4><br><p>I'm leaving something for you.<br>
It sounds like a whistle.<br>
You can hula hoop with it.<br>
As long as you keep moving,<br>
it will dance with you forever.<br>
<br>
But when you stop it will drop<br>
to the ground without a sound,<br>
waiting to be picked up again<br>
and danced with.</p>
