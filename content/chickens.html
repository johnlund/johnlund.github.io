<h2>Mind Chickens</h2><h4>December 14, 2011</h4><br><p>Sometimes I offer my close friends a description of the machinery in my mind, and they often laugh when they hear the account. I tell them to imagine a flat plain, expanding off in all directions to the horizon. It is littered with many morsels of different flavors, shapes and sizes. These nuggets of information are the ideas I have picked up during my life. One may be the concept of a new technology that I read about on the internet, another might have to do with how societal pressures inevitably build up to a point of protest, or it could be the memory of a shared moment with a loved one. There are countless ideas all across this parched landscape.<br>
<br>Aimlessly pecking around this world are giant chickens. These chickens play the vital role of eating the seeds of information strewn about. They constantly keep my mind free of clutter by removing these thoughts so that new ones can take their place. But more importantly, the thoughts they eat are digested by them–broken down and re-formed–finally to be laid as eggs. Each of these eggs combines ideas from many places in my mind, which have been gathered from innumerable experiences in my real life. Some of these eggs blossom into wonderful, creative, new ideas; while others lay unprotected and are eventually forgotten.</p>
