<h2>A Tribute to Darwin</h2><h4>July 7, 2007</h4><br><p>Darwin, the name itself invokes a greatness that can only truly be known through observation and first-hand knowledge. Years ago I got to know Darwin, one of the last great explorers, adventurers and philosophers that the world has had the luck to be blessed with. I met him as we all did, in the comfort of the living room, amidst the soft glow of incandescent lighting and the buzzing of the television droning on in the background. Who knew how far he had traveled—the journey he must have made to meet us. All I know is that at first glance, I was struck by his determination and almost nonsensical love for the unknown. But I am getting ahead of myself; perhaps I can share with you the most important teachings of Darwin by relating to you my own time in his presence.
<br><br>
After my first meeting with Darwin, I was immediately touched by his ability to make everyone in the room more comfortable. He was not one of those awkward creatures, making everyone nervous and jittery, quite the contrary. By his presence alone the world seemed as if it was a better place. He constantly reminded us of the small miracles of life that we can find if we only look.
<br><br>
As I got to know him more and more I realized that he was no different from you or me. Yes, he may have looked different with his small beady eyes, beak-like nose and uncanny ability to hold his breath. But underneath his shell-like exterior there was a compassionate, loving creature. He always appreciated a friend, sometimes following us around for hours, entranced with the wonder and splendor that he saw. And he would never refuse to share a meal with you when the opportunity arose.
<br><br>
Darwin kept his home like he kept his heart, cluttered and full of life. I was never surprised to look in on Darwin and hardly be able to see him through all of the plants he kept around him. He enjoyed rearranging his things on his own but also with friends, and he valued the help of anyone when it came to tidying up. Once and awhile we would introduce Darwin to new friends and hope that they would get along, but he was a solitary creature, protective of his home and his friends. Not many that lived in constant contact with Darwin could handle his animal-like morality—he was not to be trifled with.
<br><br>
Though… perhaps there was one. The creature known as the Colonel seemed to be the only one able to put up with Darwin. The rugged face and body of the Colonel were hardened by harsh years battling in the tropical climates, fighting off savages and surviving only on pond scum and algae. It was in him that Darwin came to know his closest friend. This was not to say that they didn’t have their friendly scuffles—in fact, that reminds me of a story.
<br><br>
When Darwin and the Colonel first meet everyone was apprehensive. The room was full of excitement and energy; we were all wondering how they would get along. We had just helped Darwin clean up his home to make a good impression on the new arrival, who we correctly thought would help Darwin clean up his life a little bit. The Colonel, being a survivor, once inside immediately set about searching his surroundings and locating food to stockpile. This unexplained activity seemed at first confusing to Darwin, but as I have touched upon, Darwin had a lifelong obsession with the unknown. He cautiously approached the new-comer, keeping his good eye trained on that ugly face. Slowly he drew nearer, and the Colonel, seemingly oblivious, kept munching away on Darwin’s abundant food supply. As we all watched, Darwin tested the patience of the creature with a lightning fast snap at his backside. The Colonel responded with an equally quick slap to the face.
<br><br>
This was to be the start of a steadfast, enduring friendship. It makes me smile to think of all the times when I would visit Darwin to see him and the Colonel snuggled up next to each other fending off the cold. They learned to share their food and to our surprise and delight, Darwin didn’t seem to mind the Colonel cleaning up everything once and awhile. I suppose you could say they proved that opposites attract. But the good times can’t last forever, and soon the Colonel began to come down with a mysterious illness.
<br><br>
After some months, we began to notice something different in their home; the plants and dirt once again returned in full force. It was unlike the Colonel to let the cleaning get away from him, and we began to fear that he may not be able to keep up with the chores. We all had our theories, but none of us knew what to do to help. Over the next few weeks we did the best we could to make sure that the Colonel was getting the medical attention that he needed but it was to no avail. He became more and more lethargic until we found him almost unresponsive. At this point there was nothing we could do but remove him to an isolated place and wait it out, hoping that he would return to health. Darwin was very dismayed, moping around for a long time after the Colonel’s departure. Unfortunately, we returned to find that the worst had happened, the Colonel had past away.
<br><br>
For the next few weeks, things slowly returned to normal, and eventually the time came in which we had to move on. Darwin, growing older and wiser was ready to venture out on his own. While we were very sad to see him go, we knew that it was for the best, he needed to see the world with his own two eyes.
<br><br>
The few of us left to help him began searching for a new place so that he might get his feet wet in familiar surroundings. Two of us stumbled upon the perfect new home, an oasis of rivers, lakes, waterfalls, trees, plants and animals that Darwin would love. We approached him with the idea and he seemed to be content with what we had found.
<br><br>
Finally, the day arrived and we led him to this new world. We left him alone swimming and climbing on the rocks in the river, just below the waterfall and above the lake. Eventually, he found some shade and seemed to be enjoying himself very much. The time came where we had to say goodbye, we each had our own time with him and shared our thoughts and hopes for his future. He returned our attention with his characteristic stare.
<br><br>
I don’t think we will ever know if Darwin made new friends, or continued with his solitary lifestyle. We may never get the chance to look into his wise old eyes and become transfixed by his grace and presence. But for those of us who knew him, Darwin will forever live on in our hearts, our minds and our souls.

Godspeed to one of the world’s greatest companions, the turtle known as Darwin.</p>
