<h2>Sorrow and Shame</h2><h4>2010</h4><br>
<p>To dream, beneath the diamond sky<br>
of all that fate has offered.<br>
The sweeping blow and spray;<br>
afraid to drown my sorrow and shame.<br>
<br>
There is a way. Cold, wet and lost.<br>
That first rush freezes the heart.<br>
For now, no pain. Only the growing<br>
warmth of the crushing icy darkness.<br>
<br>
Years past fly by as desire gives way<br>
to fear. There is still pain left that<br>
must be purged. A deed half-finished<br>
brings only more sorrow and shame.<br>
<br>
At last it's done. There's nothing inside<br>
but joy and exaltation. The pain left with<br>
the cold, the shame with the strength,<br>
and the sorrow with the hope.<br>
<br>
An eternal moment of dreams: what's<br>
lost forever, and what will never be<br>
dreamt again. Was it worth it? The<br>
selfish purity of soul that robbed the world.</p>
