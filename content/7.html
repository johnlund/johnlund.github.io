<h2></h2><h4>January 4, 2009</h4><br><p>The decision to flee comes suddenly, or has it always been there–waiting in chains with glazed eyes until the right moment–striking out at its master with fury and taking to the skies? I don't know when or whether I will return to this place, eager once again to take part in the glorious rape of the rest of the world. I do know that once the decision is made it will be final. The men with deep pockets and hungry eyes made sure of that. Their reach can be seen in every decision I make. There will be no turning back to face the wolves–only forward, into blissful freedom and lonely oblivion.</p>
